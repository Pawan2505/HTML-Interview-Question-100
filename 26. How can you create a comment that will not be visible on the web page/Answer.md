### **26. How can you create a comment that will not be visible on the web page?**

To create a comment in HTML that is not visible on the web page, use the **`<!-- -->`** syntax. Everything inside this syntax is treated as a comment and is not displayed in the browser.

**Example**:
```html
<!-- This is a comment and won't be visible on the web page -->
```
