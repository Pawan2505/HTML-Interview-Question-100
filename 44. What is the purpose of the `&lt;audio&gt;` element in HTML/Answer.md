**44. What is the purpose of the `<audio>` element in HTML?**

The `<audio>` element is used to embed audio content on a web page. It allows you to specify audio sources and provides controls for playback, such as play, pause, and volume adjustments.

### **Example:**
```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

In this example, the `<audio>` element is used to embed an audio file (`audio.mp3`). The `controls` attribute provides the necessary controls for the user to interact with the audio file, such as play, pause, and volume control. If the browser doesn't support the audio element, the fallback text "Your browser does not support the audio element" will be displayed.
