### **38. How can you create a hidden input field in HTML?**

To create a hidden input field, you use the `<input>` element with the `type="hidden"` attribute. These fields are not visible to users but can store data that will be submitted with a form or used by JavaScript.

**Example**:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="hiddenField" value="hiddenValue">
```

In this example:
- The `type="hidden"` makes the input field invisible to the user.
- The `name` attribute specifies the name of the hidden field, which is used to reference it when submitting the form.
- The `value` attribute defines the value stored in the hidden input field. This value will be sent along with the form when submitted.
