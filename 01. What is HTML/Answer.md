### **1. What is HTML?**

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard markup language used to create the **structure** and **content** of web pages. HTML uses a system of tags and elements to define how content such as text, images, videos, links, forms, and other types of content are arranged and displayed in a browser.

### **Key Points to Highlight:**

1. **Markup Language**: 
   HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language. This means it structures content by marking up text with tags. These tags indicate how the content should be presented by the browser.

2. **Structure of a Web Page**:
   HTML defines the structure of a web page by organizing different elements like headers, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. This helps in creating the layout of a webpage.

3. **Basic Syntax**:
   HTML is made up of **elements** that consist of opening and closing tags. For example:
   ```html
   <tagname>Content</tagname>
   ```
   Example:
   ```html
   <h1>This is a header</h1>
   ```

4. **Tags**: 
   HTML uses various predefined tags to create the elements on the webpage. Some common HTML tags include:
   - `<html>`: Defines the beginning and end of an HTML document.
   - `<head>`: Contains metadata like title, links to stylesheets, etc.
   - `<body>`: Contains the main content of the web page.
   - `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h6>`: Header tags for headings.
   - `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
   - `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink.
   - `<img>`: Embeds an image.
   - `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Defines lists.

5. **HTML5**:
   HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, which includes new features such as:
   - New semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`, helping developers create more meaningful web page structures.
   - Support for multimedia (audio and video) elements directly within the markup using `<audio>` and `<video>` tags.
   - The `<canvas>` element for drawing graphics via JavaScript.
   - Enhanced support for forms, including new input types like `email`, `tel`, `date`, etc.

6. **Document Object Model (DOM)**: 
   HTML documents are structured as a tree of elements, which is referred to as the Document Object Model (DOM). JavaScript interacts with this tree structure to manipulate the HTML content dynamically.

### **Why HTML is Important in Web Development:**
- **Foundation of Web Development**: HTML is the backbone of any webpage. Every other web technology like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript builds on top of HTML to style and add functionality to web pages.
- **Browser Interpretation**: Web browsers interpret HTML to render the content and structure of a web page, ensuring consistency across different platforms.
- **SEO Friendly**: HTML plays a crucial role in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) because search engines read HTML to index and rank web pages.

### **Example of Simple HTML Document:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is an example of an HTML page.</p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a> to visit an example website.
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>Â© 2025 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### **Note:**:
HTML is essential for building the foundation of any web page. It structures the content and enables web browsers to render the page correctly. The latest version, **HTML5**, includes modern features that improve functionality, multimedia support, and accessibility. Without HTML, there would be no web pages, as it's the fundamental language that structures and displays the content on the internet.
