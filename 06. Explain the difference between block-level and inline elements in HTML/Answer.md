### **6. Explain the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML.**

**Block-level elements**:
- Start on a new line and take up the full width available within their parent container.
- Can contain other block-level or inline elements.
- Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>`

**Inline elements**:
- Do not start on a new line; they flow within the content of other elements.
- Only take up as much width as necessary.
- Cannot contain block-level elements.
- Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`

**Key differences**:
- **Block-level elements** create a "block" of content, causing a line break before and after the element.
- **Inline elements** do not cause line breaks and are typically used for styling or formatting specific parts of the content.

**Example**:
```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
  <span>This is inline text inside a block-level element.</span>
</div>
```
