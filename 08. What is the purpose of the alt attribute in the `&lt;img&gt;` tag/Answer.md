### **8. What is the purpose of the alt attribute in the `<img>` tag?**

The **`alt`** attribute in the `<img>` tag provides **alternative text** for an image. This text is displayed if the image cannot be loaded, and it is also used by screen readers to improve accessibility for visually impaired users.

**Benefits**:
- **Accessibility**: Helps screen readers describe the image to users who cannot see it.
- **SEO**: Search engines use the alt text to understand the content of the image, improving the page's search engine ranking.

**Example**:
```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
```

In this example, if **logo.png** cannot be loaded, the text **"Company Logo"** will be displayed instead.
