### **10. What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>` elements in HTML?**

- **`<div>`**:
  - **Block-level element**.
  - Used to group larger chunks of content and structure the page.
  - Takes up the full width available, causing a line break before and after.
  - Typically used for layout and styling larger sections of the page.
  
- **`<span>`**:
  - **Inline element**.
  - Used to style or apply actions to specific portions of text or inline content.
  - Does not cause line breaks and only takes up as much width as necessary.

**Example**:
```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a block-level container.</p>
</div>

<span>This is inline text styled differently.</span>
```

In this example, `<div>` is used for larger content grouping, while `<span>` is used for styling a specific piece of text.
