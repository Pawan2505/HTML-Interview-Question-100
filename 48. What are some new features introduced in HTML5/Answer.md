**48. What are some new features introduced in HTML5?**

HTML5 introduced several new features that significantly enhance the capabilities of web development. Some key features include:

1. **New Semantic Elements**: 
   - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` provide more meaningful structure to web pages, improving accessibility and SEO.

2. **Multimedia Elements**:
   - `<audio>` and `<video>` tags allow native embedding of audio and video content, reducing the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

3. **Form Enhancements**:
   - New input types (e.g., `email`, `date`, `number`) and attributes (e.g., `required`, `placeholder`, `autofocus`) improve form handling and validation.
   - Built-in form validation, such as checking if a field contains a valid email address or a specific date format.

4. **Canvas**:
   - The `<canvas>` element allows for dynamic drawing of graphics, such as charts, images, and animations, directly in the browser using JavaScript.

5. **Local Storage and Session Storage**:
   - `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` provide a way to store data on the client-side, which persists even when the browser is closed (for `localStorage`), or only for the duration of a session (for `sessionStorage`).

6. **Geolocation API**:
   - HTML5 supports the Geolocation API, enabling websites to access the geographical location of a user (with their permission).

7. **Offline Capabilities**:
   - The `applicationCache` API (though now deprecated in favor of service workers) enabled offline functionality for web apps.

8. **Web Workers**:
   - Web Workers allow running JavaScript in the background, improving performance by offloading heavy computations without blocking the user interface.

These features combined help create more dynamic, interactive, and responsive websites, with native support for multimedia and richer user experiences.
