### **32. How can you create a checkbox in HTML?**

To create a checkbox in HTML, you use the `<input>` element with the `type="checkbox"` attribute. This will generate a clickable checkbox that can be checked or unchecked by the user.

**Example**:
```html
<input type="checkbox" id="agree">
<label for="agree">I agree to the terms and conditions</label>
```

In this example, the checkbox is created with the ID "agree". The label is associated with the checkbox, allowing the user to click the label text to toggle the checkbox.
