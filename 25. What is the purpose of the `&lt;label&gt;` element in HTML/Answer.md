### **25. What is the purpose of the `<label>` element in HTML?**

The **`<label>`** element is used to associate text with form elements like **`<input>`**, **`<textarea>`**, or **`<select>`**. It enhances accessibility by allowing users to click on the label to focus on the associated form element.

**Example**:
```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username">
```

In this example, clicking on the "Username:" label will focus on the corresponding input field.
