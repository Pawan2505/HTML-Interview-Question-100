### **4. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**

**HTML5** is the latest version of HTML, offering several improvements over previous versions:

1. **New Elements**:
   - HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`, which improve the structure and readability of web pages.

2. **Multimedia Support**:
   - HTML5 natively supports multimedia elements such as `<audio>` and `<video>`, allowing easier embedding of media without relying on plugins like Flash.

3. **Local Storage**:
   - HTML5 provides **localStorage** and **sessionStorage** for storing data on the clientâ€™s browser, enabling offline web applications.

4. **APIs**:
   - HTML5 includes new APIs like the **Geolocation API**, **Web Workers**, and **Canvas API** for enhanced functionality and interactivity.

5. **Deprecated Features**:
   - HTML5 eliminates the need for certain elements like `<font>` and `<center>`, focusing on CSS for styling and layout.

**In summary**: HTML5 enhances web development by supporting modern features, better multimedia handling, and improved storage capabilities compared to earlier versions of HTML.
