### **22. How can you create a hyperlink that links to an email address?**

To create a hyperlink that links to an email address, use the **`<a>`** (anchor) element and include the **`mailto:`** protocol followed by the email address.

**Example**:
```html
<a href="mailto:example@example.com">Send an email</a>
```

This will create a link that opens the user's default email client with a new message addressed to the specified email.
