### **35. What is the purpose of the `disabled` attribute in form elements?**

The `disabled` attribute is used to make a form element non-editable, preventing user interaction. When an element is disabled, it cannot be clicked, selected, or modified by the user. This can be useful when you want to temporarily prevent interaction with a field, such as during form validation or when a certain condition is not met.

**Example**:
```html
<input type="text" disabled>
```

In this example, the text input field is disabled, meaning users cannot type in it or interact with it.
