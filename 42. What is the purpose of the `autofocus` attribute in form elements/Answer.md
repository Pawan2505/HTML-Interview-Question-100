The `autofocus` attribute in HTML is used to automatically focus on a specific form element (such as an input field, textarea, or select dropdown) as soon as the page is loaded. This makes it convenient for users, as they can immediately start interacting with the form without needing to click on the input field first.

### **Example:**
```html
<input type="text" autofocus>
```

In this example, the text input field will automatically be focused when the page is loaded, allowing the user to start typing right away. The `autofocus` attribute is typically used on forms or input elements that need to be filled out quickly, such as login forms or search bars.
