### **31. What is the purpose of the `required` attribute in form elements?**

The `required` attribute in HTML is used to indicate that a form input field must be filled out before the form can be submitted. It ensures that the user provides the necessary information in that field.

**Example**:
```html
<input type="text" required>
```

In this example, the input field is marked as required. If the user tries to submit the form without filling it out, the browser will display a message prompting them to complete the field.
