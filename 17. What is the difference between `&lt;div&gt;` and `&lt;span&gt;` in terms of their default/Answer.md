### **17. What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>` in terms of their default behavior?**

- **`<div>`** is a **block-level element**, meaning it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
- **`<span>`** is an **inline element**, meaning it only takes up as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.

**Example**:
```html
<div>This is a block-level element</div>
<span>This is an inline element</span>
``` 

**`<div>`** creates a block that takes up the entire width, while **`<span>`** stays within the flow of text.
