### **3. What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration in HTML?**

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration specifies the **document type** and **version** of HTML being used. It helps the web browser understand how to correctly render the HTML document. 

For modern HTML, the declaration is `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which tells the browser that the document is written in **HTML5**.

### **Why it's important:**
- Ensures that the browser renders the page in **standards mode**, making the page more consistent across different browsers.
- Helps avoid quirks mode, where browsers might render the page based on older rules, leading to inconsistencies.

**Example**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Page Title</title></head>
  <body><h1>Hello World</h1></body>
</html>
```
