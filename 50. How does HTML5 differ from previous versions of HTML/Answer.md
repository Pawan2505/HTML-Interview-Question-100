**50. How does HTML5 differ from previous versions of HTML?**

HTML5 brings several significant improvements and new features compared to previous versions of HTML, making it a more powerful and modern tool for web development. Key differences include:

1. **New Semantic Elements**: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`, which help structure the content in a more meaningful way, improving readability, SEO, and accessibility.

2. **Multimedia Support**: HTML5 includes native support for multimedia elements like `<audio>` and `<video>`, eliminating the need for third-party plugins (such as Flash) for embedding audio and video content.

3. **APIs and Web Storage**: HTML5 provides new APIs like the **Canvas API** for drawing graphics, the **Geolocation API** for location-based services, and local and session storage (`localStorage` and `sessionStorage`) for client-side data storage.

4. **Mobile Compatibility**: HTML5 is designed with mobile devices in mind, offering features like responsive design and touch events, ensuring better performance and compatibility across different devices.

5. **Form Elements**: HTML5 introduces new form input types like `email`, `tel`, `date`, and `url`, along with attributes like `placeholder`, `required`, and `autofocus`, improving form validation and user experience.

6. **Cleaner Code**: With the addition of semantic elements and other improvements, HTML5 encourages more organized and readable code, reducing the reliance on non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>`.

In summary, HTML5 offers better multimedia support, improved structure for web pages, enhanced mobile compatibility, and more powerful APIs, making it a major upgrade from previous versions of HTML.
