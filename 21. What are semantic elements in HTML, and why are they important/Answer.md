### **21. What are semantic elements in HTML, and why are they important?**

Semantic elements in HTML provide meaning to the content they enclose, helping to structure the web page in a more meaningful way. Examples include **`<header>`**, **`<nav>`**, **`<main>`**, **`<section>`**, **`<article>`**, and **`<footer>`**.

**Importance**:
- Improve the **structure** and **accessibility** of the page.
- Make content more understandable for **search engines** and **screen readers**.
- Help with **SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) by giving more context to the content.
