**49. What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration in HTML5?**

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration in HTML5 specifies the document type and the version of HTML being used, which is HTML5 in this case. It is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document to inform the browser about the version of HTML it should use to render the page.

This declaration ensures that the web page is displayed in **standards mode**, meaning the browser will follow the latest web standards and specifications for rendering the page. Without it, the browser might render the page in **quirks mode**, which could lead to inconsistent and unexpected rendering, especially when using older or non-standard HTML code. 

In summary, the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is necessary for ensuring that the page is rendered correctly and adheres to modern web standards.
