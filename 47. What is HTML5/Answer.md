**47. What is HTML5?**

HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) used to structure and present content on the web. It introduces new elements, attributes, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that improve support for multimedia (like audio, video, and interactive content) and offer better semantic meaning. HTML5 enhances the ability to create responsive, mobile-friendly, and feature-rich websites without relying on plugins like Flash. Some key features of HTML5 include:

- New semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>`.
- Native support for audio and video embedding with `<audio>` and `<video>` tags.
- Enhanced form controls such as `<input>` types (e.g., `email`, `date`, `number`) and new attributes.
- Local storage for storing data on the client-side without needing cookies.
- APIs for geolocation, offline storage, and more.

Overall, HTML5 aims to make web development easier, more versatile, and more capable of supporting modern web applications.
