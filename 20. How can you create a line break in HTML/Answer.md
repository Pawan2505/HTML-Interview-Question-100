### **20. How can you create a line break in HTML?**

To create a line break, use the **`<br>`** element. It creates a single line break without any additional spacing.

**Example**:
```html
<p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>
```

This will display the two lines of text, each on a separate line.
