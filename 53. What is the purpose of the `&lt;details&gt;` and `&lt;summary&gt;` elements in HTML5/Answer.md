**53. What is the purpose of the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements in HTML5?**

The `<details>` and `<summary>` elements are used to create interactive disclosure widgets. These elements allow you to hide and reveal additional content on a webpage, providing a way for users to expand or collapse information as needed. 

- **`<summary>`**: This element provides a summary or heading for the disclosure widget. It is always visible and serves as the clickable part that reveals or hides the content inside the `<details>` element.
- **`<details>`**: This element contains the additional information that can be shown or hidden. The content inside the `<details>` element is initially hidden and can be toggled by clicking the `<summary>` element.

### Example:
```html
<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal more information</summary>
  <p>This is the additional information.</p>
</details>
```

### How it works:
- The `<summary>` element is shown to the user as a clickable header.
- When the user clicks the `<summary>` element, the content inside the `<details>` element (in this case, the `<p>` tag with the additional information) is revealed.
- If the user clicks again, the content will collapse, hiding the extra information.

### Key Points:
- This feature enhances user experience by providing a clean and interactive way to present more information without overwhelming the page.
- The `<details>` and `<summary>` elements are supported natively in most modern browsers and do not require additional JavaScript.
